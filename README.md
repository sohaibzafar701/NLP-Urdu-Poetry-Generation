## How to run this code:

1. Upload 'faiz.txt', 'galib.txt' and 'iqbal.txt' in colab or jupyter notebook
2. Open 'P20-0574.ipynb' code file
3. run all the cells in sequence

### Contributions:
im open to suggestions and contributions if any, as this program randomly selects the ending words with similar rythm to make it like the poetry and it chooses other words in lines randomly as well, so if you have any better opinion then make contributions :)
